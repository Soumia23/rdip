<h1>Electronics and Communications Engineering</h1>
<p>Electronic engineering (also called electronics and communications engineering) is an electrical engineering discipline which utilizes nonlinear and active electrical components (such as semiconductor devices, especially transistors, diodes and integrated circuits) to design electronic circuits, devices, VLSI(very large-scale integration) devices and their systems. The discipline typically also designs passive electrical components, usually based on printed circuit boards. </p>
